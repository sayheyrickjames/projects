# About Threads

## 1.1 Introduction

Threads is a visual design language for our users that outlines individual component and layout specifications. It currently covers the Plaid Marketing site (plaid.com).

It is intended to be a living document that will be updated as we continue to develop the tenets and specifics of our system. It functions as a point of record, as well as our central place for design collaboration.
