# About Threads

## 1.1 Introduction

Threads is a visual design language for our users that outlines individual component and layout specifications. It currently covers the Plaid Marketing site (plaid.com).

It is intended to be a living document that will be updated as we continue to develop the tenets and specifics of our system. It functions as a point of record, as well as our central place for design collaboration.

## 1.2 Goals

### Define our visual language
Incorporate everything we’ve learned on all sides of our business into one cohesive point of view describing how we visually speak and articulate our value proposition to our customers.

### Develop a single system
Provide a unified experience across platforms and device sizes, for all internal stakeholders to easily build, maintain and iterate.

## 1.4 Working with Threads

### Getting started
There’s a few simple things you can do to quickly get up to speed.

1. Go over this guide and collect any questions or comments to share with the Threads team.
2. Attend an overview orientation.
3. Review Threads and the file system with your manager or Threads point of contact.

### Accessing files
All Threads source files are stored on Dropbox in the Plaid Design share.

- You’ll need access to [Plaid Design](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/30z9wytvz8pj0h7/AAC8gSg31nm1YNfngvXpXtFea?dl=0). You can request this through IT.

- Once you have access, all files are in [04-Threads](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8j33v6f5banlxkh/AACfUS44bXwtKcsboTdJluQra?dl=0).

### Getting specs
We use [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to maintain all component and screen specs.

[Download Zeplin for Mac](https://zpl.io/download-mac)
** You can also use Zeplin in your browser once you’re added to the project. **

For Designers, make sure you have the [Sketch plugin](https://github.com/zeplin/zeplin-sketch-plugin/archive/v1.2.zip) installed. You can then add your new design work to Threads.

Get added to the project by emailing [threads-team@](mailto:threads@plaid.com?Subject=Requesting%20Zeplin%20access.) and asking for access to Zeplin. You can also message us in our Hipchat room for access.

## 1.5 Threads Support

### We're here to help
The Threads team wants to make it as easy as possible for you to work with the Threads Design System. When you run into challenges or have questions, email [threads-team@](mailto:threads@plaid.com?Subject=I%20could%20use%20help%20with%20Threads!) or message us in our Hipchat room as soon as something comes up. In general, we’ll be able to answer most questions right away, with a few taking less than 24 hours.

### Notice something missing or need an edit?
While we try to consistently maintain Threads and keep it an accurate reflection of our current build, there will be times where content will be out of sync until we’re able to update this guide.

When you find an edit or see a feature, component or layout missing from Threads:

- Send an email to [threads-team@](mailto:threads@plaid.com?Subject=Threads%20edit.) or a message to our Hipchat room.
- Let your PM know that there needs to be updates made to Threads.

## 1.6 Creating a new Threads request

### go/threads-request
If you’ve asked for help, identified a new component or feature that needs to be created, etc., the Threads team may ask you to submit a new, more thorough work request. We’ll scope and prioritize the work, then get back to you with any questions and an estimated delivery date.

# Style
